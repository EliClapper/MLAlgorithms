Gini index is the cost function in classification trees. It is a measure of purity that calculates how well a certain split correctly classifies cases.
perfect seperation results in Gini = 0, which means we would correctly classify every case.
If we would not do better than chance, so a 50/50 split (given there are 2 groups with equal lengths of 50 cases each), then Gini = 0.5.
