The Multivariate normal probability density function is defined as
$$
 f(\boldsymbol{x}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{(2\pi)^{\frac{n}{2}}|\Sigma|^{1/2}}}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(x-\mu)'\Sigma^{-1}(x-\mu)}
$$
where $\boldsymbol{x}$ is a matrix of random variables, $\Sigma$ is covariance matrix of $\boldsymbol{x}$, and $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is the vector of means for the random variables.
